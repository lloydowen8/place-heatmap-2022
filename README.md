# r/Place 2022 heatmap

The code is open source and free to use, all I ask is you give credit (to either u/DeathByElectives or the repo) if you do post any visualisations. 

If you don't have experience in coding but still want to explore the data (blender, etc) it is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BSaWgy8okppoEIYT5xodkrJb7-fL0RBm/view?usp=sharing 

## Running heatmap script

- Install python
- Install dependences (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Configure `Config.yaml` to specify region of canvas.
- Run `python heatmap.py`

Scraper code adapted from [Robin Gisler](https://github.com/gislerro/)

## Running heatmap notebook

- Download the image data from [here](https://place.thatguyalex.com/)
  - Extract image data from the zip into the top-level directory, so that the `images_` folders are in `./final_v1/`

- Install Python and the dependences listed in `requirements.txt` (by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

- Open the notebook in your IDE of choice and run

## Aany pull requests and suggestions are welcome

- There is plenty to be improved on here, would be a good first project for someone looking to get into image processing.
  - Some ideas have been suggested in the issues tab to get someone started

# r/Place 2022 heatmap

The code is open source and free to use, all I ask is you give credit (to either u/DeathByElectives or the repo) if you do post any visualisations. 

## Running heatmap locally

- Download the image data from [here](https://place.thatguyalex.com/)

- Install Python and the dependences listed in `requirements.txt` (by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

- Open the notebook in your IDE of choice and run (Plan on adding a standalone script shortly)


## This will remain an open source project so any pull requests and suggestions are welcome

- There is still plenty to be done, I've made a list of known problems and improvements in issues.

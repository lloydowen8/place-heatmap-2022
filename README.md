# r/Place 2022 heatmap

The code is open source and free to use, all I ask is you give credit (to either u/DeathByElectives or the repo) if you do post any visualisations. 

If you don't have experience in coding but still want to explore the data (blender, etc) it is available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BSaWgy8okppoEIYT5xodkrJb7-fL0RBm/view?usp=sharing 

## Running heatmap locally

- Download the image data from [here](https://place.thatguyalex.com/)
  - Extract image data from the zip into the top-level directory, so that the `images_` folders are in `./final_v1/`

- Install Python and the dependences listed in `requirements.txt` (by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
  - Python 3.9 or earlier is recommended - if you are using Python 3.10, the required version of numpy may fail to build.

- Open the notebook in your IDE of choice and run

## This will remain an open source project so any pull requests and suggestions are welcome

- There is plenty to be improved on here, would be a good first project for someone looking to get into image processing.
  - Some ideas have been suggested in the issues tab to get someone started
